Welcome to **Joe & Deb’s Heritage Hog Farm**, nestled in the scenic hills of Mountain Grove, Missouri. Here, under the gentle shade of oak trees, our Red Wattle hogs enjoy life as nature intended—rooting in lush pastures, cooling off in playful mud baths, and savoring acorns and wholesome feed. We treat our animals with care and respect, and as a result, they thrive happily and comfortably close to our home.

We’re pleased to offer pasture-raised, whole Red Wattle hogs with a personal touch from start to finish. Our 2024 farrow has already found new homes, but we’re accepting pre-orders for 2025 without any deposit required. We’ll send you a friendly reminder two weeks before the farrow arrives so you can prepare for your new addition. With some good fortune, we may welcome up to 30 piglets this season!
