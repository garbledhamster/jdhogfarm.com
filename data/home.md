Welcome to J & D's Heritage Hog Farm, tucked away in the rolling hills of Mountain Grove, Missouri. Our Red Wattle hogs roam under oak trees, play in mud baths, and snack on acorns, just as nature intended. We give each hog the space, time, and respect they deserve, because we believe that when animals are raised with care, everyone benefits. We’re glad you’re here and invite you to see how real, honest farming brings out the best in both the land and its animals.
