### Red Wattle Hogs – Pasture-Raised, Heritage Breed

Our Red Wattle hogs are raised outdoors on pasture with room to roam, forage, and grow at a natural pace. The result is richly marbled pork with deep flavor—perfect for families who want to stock their freezer or food lovers who want the very best.

### Our Hog Options
